# Location Management Refactor Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to refactor the Urban Commute Assistant app's location management system to fix data inconsistencies, location capture issues, and improve overall continuity.

## Current Issues Identified
- Multiple conflicting location sources (user.location, geolocation, selectedLocation)
- Inconsistent location handling between components
- Race conditions in data fetching
- No centralized location management
- Dashboard cards showing incorrect data
- Location capture reliability issues

## Proposed Solution: 5-Step Refactor

### Step 1: Create Centralized Location Service
**Objective:** Build a single, reliable location service to handle all GPS and location operations

#### Files to Create:
- `frontend/src/services/locationService.js`

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Create LocationService class** with methods:
   - `getCurrentLocation()` - Get one-time location
   - `watchPosition()` - Continuous location monitoring
   - `notifyCallbacks()` - Event system for location updates
   - `getFallbackLocation()` - Default Bellevue location

2. **Key Features:**
   - Singleton pattern for app-wide use
   - Built-in caching (1-minute cache for performance)
   - Error handling with fallbacks
   - Configurable accuracy settings
   - Callback system for real-time updates

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful degradation when GPS unavailable
   - Timeout handling (10-second default)
   - Permission denial handling
   - Fallback to default Bellevue coordinates

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Service provides consistent location data across app
- [x] Handles permission denied gracefully
- [x] Implements proper cleanup for watchers
- [x] Falls back to Bellevue when GPS fails

#### ✅ **COMPLETED** - Files Created:
- `frontend/src/services/locationService.ts` - Centralized location service with singleton pattern
- `frontend/src/services/locationService.test.ts` - Basic test file for validation

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance across the entire application
- **Caching**: 1-minute cache to prevent redundant GPS requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to Bellevue coordinates (47.6101, -122.2015)
- **Callback System**: Event-driven updates for real-time location changes
- **Cleanup Management**: Proper disposal of location watchers
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with interfaces
- **Browser Compatibility**: Handles browsers without geolocation support

---

### Step 2: Simplify Redux Store Structure
**Objective:** Create a clear, single-source-of-truth location state management

#### Files to Modify:
- `frontend/src/store/userSlice.js` (or `.ts`)

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Restructure state schema:**
   ```javascript
   {
     currentLocation: null,        // GPS location
     locationStatus: 'unknown',    // loading/success/error/unknown
     locationError: null,          // Error message if any
     selectedDestination: null,    // User's chosen destination
     savedLocations: [],          // Predefined locations (Home, Work, etc.)
     preferences: {}              // User settings
   }
   ```

2. **Create new action creators:**
   - `setCurrentLocation(location)` - Update GPS location
   - `setLocationLoading()` - Set loading state
   - `setLocationError(error)` - Handle location errors
   - `setSelectedDestination(destination)` - Set trip destination
   - `addSavedLocation(location)` - Add new saved location

3. **Remove deprecated actions:**
   - Any actions that manage multiple location states
   - Conflicting location setters

#### Migration Steps:
1. Backup current userSlice
2. Update state structure
3. Update all action creators
4. Test state transitions
5. Update any components using old actions

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Single source of truth for all location data
- [ ] Clear separation between current location and destination
- [ ] No conflicting location states
- [ ] All location updates flow through Redux

---

### Step 3: Create Location Hook
**Objective:** Provide a simple, reusable interface for components to access location data

#### Files to Create:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useLocation.js`

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Create useLocation hook:**
   - Integrates with LocationService
   - Manages Redux state updates
   - Provides location status information
   - Handles cleanup on unmount

2. **Return interface:**
   ```javascript
   {
     currentLocation,     // Current GPS coordinates
     locationStatus,      // loading/success/error/unknown
     locationError,       // Error message if any
     isLoading,          // Boolean for loading state
     hasLocation,        // Boolean for successful location
     hasError           // Boolean for error state
   }
   ```

3. **Automatic features:**
   - Starts location watching on mount
   - Updates Redux store with location changes
   - Cleans up watchers on unmount
   - Handles errors and updates store accordingly

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Components can easily access location data
- [ ] Automatic location watching lifecycle
- [ ] Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Clear loading and error states

---

### Step 4: Create Data Fetching Hook
**Objective:** Centralize all API data fetching based on location changes

#### Files to Create:
- `frontend/src/hooks/useLocationData.js`

#### Implementation Tasks:
1. **Create useLocationData hook:**
   - Fetches weather, traffic, and transit data
   - Responds to location changes automatically
   - Implements periodic refresh (5-minute intervals)
   - Manages loading states for all APIs

2. **Data coordination:**
   - Single useEffect for all API calls
   - Prevents redundant API requests
   - Coordinates loading states
   - Handles API errors gracefully

3. **Performance optimizations:**
   - Only fetch when location actually changes
   - Implement request debouncing
   - Cleanup intervals on unmount
   - Cache management

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All API data stays in sync with location
- [ ] No redundant API calls
- [ ] Coordinated loading states
- [ ] Automatic refresh every 5 minutes

---

### Step 5: Update Components
**Objective:** Simplify all location-dependent components to use the new centralized system

#### Files to Modify:
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Map/MapContainer.jsx`
- Any other location-dependent components

#### Dashboard Component Tasks:
1. **Remove location logic:**
   - Delete manual geolocation calls
   - Remove location state management
   - Remove data fetching logic

2. **Use new hooks:**
   - Replace with `useLocation()` hook
   - Replace with `useLocationData()` hook
   - Simplify component to pure UI logic

3. **Improve UX:**
   - Better loading states
   - Clear error messages
   - Fallback UI when location unavailable

#### Map Component Tasks:
1. **Simplify location handling:**
   - Use centralized location data
   - Remove duplicate location requests
   - Use Redux for destination data

2. **Improve reliability:**
   - Handle missing location gracefully
   - Better error states
   - Automatic re-centering when location updates

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Components have no location management logic
- [ ] Consistent user experience across all components
- [ ] Proper loading and error states
- [ ] No race conditions in data display
