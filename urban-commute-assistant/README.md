# urban-commute-assistant

## Project Overview
The Urban Commute Assistant is an interactive real-time web application designed to help daily commuters navigate urban environments more effectively. By integrating various urban data streams, including traffic conditions, weather updates, and public transportation schedules, the application provides users with personalized commuting suggestions based on their current location and destination.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an interactive web application that integrates diverse urban data streams to assist commuters in making informed daily decisions.
- Present real-time urban data clearly to users, providing actionable commuting suggestions based on current environmental and transit conditions.
- Tailor recommendations based on user location and destination information, enabling personalized commuting solutions.

## Target Users
- **Daily Commuters**: Professionals and students in urban settings who regularly navigate city infrastructure.
  - Need timely and accessible information about current environmental conditions (weather, traffic, transportation).
  - Require proactive notifications regarding disruptions or delays in their daily commute.
  - Seek alternative commuting suggestions when disruptions or unfavorable conditions arise.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Aggregates data from multiple web APIs for traffic, weather, and public transportation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides real-time visualizations of urban data conditions and a map-based interface indicating active disruptions and recommended alternatives.
- **User Notifications**: Allows users to set preferences for alerts and updates regarding their commute.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers tailored commuting solutions based on user preferences and real-time data.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Redux for state management, and CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for building the API, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and various third-party APIs for data integration.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user data and preferences.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization and deployment.

## Special Constraints
- Compliance with data privacy regulations, specifically the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), regarding management and protection of user data.

## Expected Outcome
- Enhanced quality of life for users through improved daily decision-making, minimized commuting stress, and increased adaptability to urban disruptions.
