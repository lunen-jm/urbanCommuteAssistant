# Machine Learning Features

## ðŸ§  Current ML Features (Implemented)

The Urban Commute Assistant includes intelligent learning capabilities that adapt to user behavior:

### âœ… Smart Learning System
- **Transport Preferences:** Remembers your preferred transport method for each destination
- **Usage Patterns:** Tracks destination frequency and shows star icons for favorites
- **Weather Adaptation:** Learns transport preferences based on weather conditions
- **Time-based Learning:** Adapts recommendations based on time of day patterns

### âœ… User Interface Features
- **Smart Defaults:** Auto-suggests your usual transport method when selecting destinations
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Shows reasons like "Your usual choice" or "Smart suggestion"
- **Smart Favorites Page:** ML-curated destination suggestions with visit analytics
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Detailed statistics on transport usage and commute patterns
- **User Feedback:** Rate recommendations to improve ML accuracy

### âœ… Privacy & Storage
- **Local Storage Only:** All ML data stored in browser localStorage
- **No External Sharing:** Learning data never leaves your device
- **User Control:** Clear all ML data anytime from Analytics page
- **Transparency:** See why each recommendation was made

## ðŸš€ Future ML Enhancements

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- **Route Optimization:** Learn optimal routes based on real-time conditions
- **Departure Time Prediction:** Suggest best departure times
- **Smart Notifications:** Proactive alerts based on learned patterns
- **Cross-device Sync:** Optional cloud sync for multi-device usage
- **Advanced Analytics:** Deeper insights and trend analysis

### Technical Implementation
- **Current:** Frontend-only ML using JavaScript utilities
- **Future:** Hybrid approach with optional backend ML services
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage (current) â†’ Optional cloud storage (future)
- **Algorithms:** Rule-based learning (current) â†’ Advanced ML models (future)

## ðŸ“Š ML Data Collected

The system tracks (locally only):
- Transport method selections per destination
- Destination visit frequency and timing
- Weather conditions during transport choices
- User feedback on recommendations
- Time-based usage patterns
