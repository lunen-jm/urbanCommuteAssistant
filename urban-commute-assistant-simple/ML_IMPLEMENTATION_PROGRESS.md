- [x] Frequency-based location promotion
- [x] Basic preference learning infrastructure
- [x] Time-based suggestion patterns
- [x] Weather adaptation suggestions

**Technical Tasks:**
- [x] Create ML utility functions for data collection
- [x] Implement local storage for user preferences
- [x] Add tracking to existing user interactions
- [x] Create preference scoring system
- [x] Update commute options to show ML-influenced recommendations

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics & User Control âœ… (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Add user feedback mechanisms and analytics dashboard

**Features to Implement:**
- [x] User feedback system for ML recommendations
- [x] Smart Favorites page with ML-curated suggestions
- [x] Analytics page showing commute patterns and insights
- [x] User preference management interface
- [x] ML model transparency (show why recommendations were made)

**Technical Tasks:**
- [x] Create Favorites page component
- [x] Create Analytics page component
- [x] Implement feedback collection system
- [x] Add preference override controls
- [x] Create data visualization components

### Phase 3: Advanced ML Features ðŸ“‹ (Future Phase)
**Goal:** Implement more sophisticated ML algorithms

**Features to Implement:**
- [ ] Route optimization learning
- [ ] Departure time prediction
- [ ] Smart notifications based on patterns
- [ ] Cross-device synchronization
- [ ] Advanced pattern recognition

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement time-series analysis for departure patterns
- [ ] Create route preference learning algorithm
- [ ] Add notification intelligence
- [ ] Backend integration for data persistence
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting

## Current Progress Status

### âœ… Completed

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- User testing and feedback collection
- ML algorithm refinement based on usage data

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (Phase 3)
- Advanced ML algorithms
- Backend integration
- Cross-device synchronization
- Departure time prediction
- Route optimization learning

## Technical Architecture

### Data Collection
```javascript
// User interaction tracking
trackUserChoice(choice, context) -> stores preferences locally
getSmartRecommendations() -> returns ML-influenced suggestions
```

### Storage Structure
```javascript
userPreferences: {
  transportMethodByDestination: { destinationId: methodId },
  destinationFrequency: { destinationId: count },
  timeBasedPreferences: { timeOfDay: preferredMethod },
  weatherPreferences: { weatherCondition: preferredMethod },
  lastSelections: { recent user choices },
  feedbackData: { user feedback on recommendations }
}
```

### ML Features Status
- **Smart Defaults**: âœ… Implemented
- **Frequency-based Favorites**: âœ… Implemented  
- **Weather Adaptation**: âœ… Implemented
- **Time-based Learning**: âœ… Implemented
- **User Feedback**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for Phase 2
- **Analytics Dashboard**: ðŸ“‹ Planned for Phase 2

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 testing and refinement
2. Design user feedback interface for Phase 2
3. Create wireframes for Analytics and Smart Favorites pages
4. Plan backend integration for data persistence
