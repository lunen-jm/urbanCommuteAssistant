# Urban Commute Assistant - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This application consists of a React frontend (deployed on Netlify) and a FastAPI backend (deployed on Render).

## Backend Deployment (Render)

### Environment Variables Required:
- `WEATHER_API_KEY` - OpenWeatherMap API key
- `TRAFFIC_API_KEY` - TomTom Traffic API key
- `SECRET_KEY` - JWT secret (auto-generated by Render)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Set to your Netlify domain (e.g., `https://yourapp.netlify.app`)

### Deploy Steps:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Use the `render.yaml` configuration file
3. Set the required environment variables
4. Backend will be available at: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com`

## Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

### Environment Variables Required:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com`)
- `VITE_TOMTOM_API_KEY` - TomTom API key for client-side map operations

### Deploy Steps:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
   - Base directory: `frontend`
3. Set the required environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. The `netlify.toml` file is pre-configured for proper routing

## Production Configuration

### Changes Made for Production:
1. ✅ Removed location coordinates from Dashboard header
2. ✅ Removed Location Debug Panel completely
3. ✅ Commented out all console.log statements (marked as "Development logging - remove in production")
4. ✅ Added proper error handling without console outputs
5. ✅ Configured environment variables for deployment
6. ✅ Added proper .gitignore files
7. ✅ Added favicon and removed placeholder

### Security:
- TomTom API keys are handled securely via environment variables
- Backend API keys are never exposed to frontend
- CORS is properly configured for production domains

## Testing Before Deployment:
```bash
# Test frontend build
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview

# Test backend
cd backend
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

## Post-Deployment:
1. Verify the frontend loads without JavaScript errors
2. Test location services
3. Test route calculation
4. Verify API connectivity between frontend and backend
5. Check that debugging information is not visible to users

## Debugging Information Removed:
- Location coordinates in header: `(lat, lng)` display
- Green debugging cards showing location status
- All console.log statements (commented out for easy re-enabling in development)
- Location debug panel with technical details

The application is now production-ready with clean UI and secure configuration.
