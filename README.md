## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.5 (backend)
- Node.js 14+ (frontend)
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-commute-assistant.git
   cd TECHIN510-Developer
   ```
2. **Quick start (recommended):**
   ```powershell
   .\Setup-Environment.ps1    # Install dependencies
   .\Start-Urban-Commute.ps1  # Start both servers
   ```
3. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `frontend/` and `backend/`
   - Add your API keys (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for details)
4. **Access the app:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## How to Add or Edit Locations

- The app includes four default locations:
  - **Home:** House in Bellevue
  - **Work:** Microsoft Redmond Campus
  - **Gym:** Crossroads Planet Fitness, Bellevue
  - **School:** Global Innovation Exchange (GIX), Bellevue
- To change these, edit the `savedLocations` array in `frontend/src/store/userSlice.js` and restart the frontend.
- Transit options always use your current location (via browser geolocation) for accuracy.

## Machine Learning Features

The app includes intelligent learning capabilities that adapt to your commute patterns:

### üß† Smart Learning System
- **Smart Defaults:** Remembers your preferred transport method for each destination
- **Usage Patterns:** Tracks destination frequency and shows star icons for favorites  
- **Weather Adaptation:** Learns transport preferences based on weather conditions
- **Analytics Dashboard:** View detailed statistics and commute patterns

### üîí Privacy-First Design
- **Local Storage Only:** All learning data stays on your device
- **Transparent Recommendations:** See why each suggestion was made
- **User Control:** Clear all ML data anytime from the Analytics page

### üì± Easy Access
Use the footer navigation to access:
- **Smart Favorites (‚≠ê):** ML-curated destination suggestions
- **Analytics (üìä):** Detailed insights and patterns
- **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è):** Manage preferences and clear data

> üß† **Learn more:** See [ML_FEATURES.md](ML_FEATURES.md) for technical details and implementation information.

## Next Steps
- **Enhanced ML Features:** Advanced route optimization and predictive analytics
- **Design System:** Comprehensive UI/UX improvements and theming
- **Performance Optimization:** Caching, API optimization, and mobile performance
