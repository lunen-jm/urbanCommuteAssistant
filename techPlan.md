# Urban Commute Assistant: Technical Architecture & Implementation Guide

## 1. System Overview

The Urban Commute Assistant is a full-stack web application designed to help commuters navigate urban environments by integrating real-time data from multiple sources:

- **Traffic conditions** (congestion, accidents, road closures)
- **Weather information** (precipitation, severe conditions)
- **Public transit data** (schedules, delays, service changes)

The system processes this information to provide personalized recommendations and alerts to users based on their specific commute patterns and preferences.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

### 3.1 Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for data fetching
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for navigation
- **UI Framework**: Chakra UI or Material UI for consistent design components
- **Map Visualization**: Mapbox GL JS with custom layers for traffic, weather, and transit data
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

│       ├── PreferenceManager
│       └── CommuteSuggestions
└── Shared Components (Loaders, Buttons, Cards, etc.)

### 3.3 State Management

- **Global State**: Redux store with slices for:
  - User data and authentication
  - Map configuration and viewport
  - Transit and traffic information
  - Notification preferences
- **Local State**: React hooks for component-specific state
- **Data Fetching**: RTK Query for API calls with automatic caching and refetching

### 3.4 Progressive Features

- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline access to critical information
- Geolocation services for location-based recommendations
- Push notifications for commute alerts (using service workers)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use cases

## 4. Backend Architecture

### 4.1 Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for structured data
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for performance optimization and session management
- **Task Processing**: Celery for background jobs and scheduled tasks
- **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### 4.2 Core Components



### 4.3 Data Integration Strategy

- **Adapter Pattern**: Standardized interfaces for different data providers
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with TTL based on data type
  - Weather data: 30-60 minute cache
  - Traffic data: 2-5 minute cache
  - Transit schedules: 24-hour cache with invalidation on disruptions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 4.4 Security & Compliance

- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Data minimization practices for CCPA compliance
- User data encryption at rest and in transit
- Granular permission system for feature access

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### 5.1 Infrastructure Options

**Cloud-Native Approach**:
- Frontend: Static hosting (AWS S3 + CloudFront, Vercel, Netlify)
- Backend: Containerized services (AWS ECS, Azure Container Apps, GCP Cloud Run)
- Database: Managed PostgreSQL service
- Cache: Managed Redis service
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

**Simpler Deployment**:
- PaaS providers like Heroku, Render, or Railway for full-stack deployment
- Managed database services
- Built-in monitoring and logging

### 5.2 Docker Components

```yaml
# Core services in docker-compose.yml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    depends_on: ["backend"]

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    depends_on: ["db", "redis"]
    environment: # Configuration and API keys

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    volumes: ["pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
    environment: # Database configuration

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    volumes: ["redis_data:/data"]

  worker:
    build: ./backend
    command: ["celery", "-A", "app.tasks", "worker"]
    depends_on: ["backend", "redis"]
```

## 6. Adding New Features

  ## 9. Current Issues to Address
  
~~Data Integration Gap: According to the README.md progress notes, "Data initial dashboard is sample data as APIs are not fully integrated" - this needs to be resolved for proper UI functionality.~~ ✓ RESOLVED: Implemented Adapter Pattern for API integrations with proper error handling and caching.

Frontend-Backend Connectivity: The deployGuide.md troubleshooting section mentions potential issues with:

✓ RESOLVED: CORS errors - Updated CORS configuration in main.py
✓ RESOLVED: API connection problems - Added health check endpoint and API tester
✓ RESOLVED: Environment variable misconfigurations (VITE_API_URL) - Updated .env.example with clear instructions

Component Integration Complexity: Your component architecture shows multiple nested components that need proper coordination:

Map Components (InteractiveMap, RouteOverlay, DisruptionMarkers)
Data Visualization components
User Interface components
State Management Implementation: The Redux store needs proper configuration for all the planned slices mentioned in section 3.3:

User data and authentication
Map configuration
Transit/traffic information
Notification preferences
